# Install-Display-link-driver-for-Ubuntu

It looks like you're trying to install a dock driver for DisplayLink graphics on Ubuntu. The steps you've provided are mostly correct, but there are a few minor adjustments and clarifications. Here's the corrected step-by-step process:

Step 1: Update package information
```bash
sudo apt update
```

Step 2: Install DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support)
```bash
sudo apt-get install dkms
```

Step 3: Install required development libraries (you mentioned `librm-dev`, but it's likely a typo, so I assume you meant `libdrm-dev`)
```bash
sudo apt install libdrm-dev
```

Step 4: Install the DisplayLink driver using the EVDI (Extensible Virtual Display Interface) DKMS package
```bash
sudo apt-get install evdi-dkms
```

Step 5: Reboot your system to load the newly installed kernel modules
```bash
sudo reboot
```

Step 6: Download the DisplayLink driver package from the provided link (https://www.synaptics.com/products/displaylink-graphics/downloads/ubuntu-5.3.1). You can use a web browser or command-line tools like `wget` to download the file.

Step 7: Extract the downloaded ZIP file. Assuming the file is named `displaylink-driver.zip` and is in your Downloads directory:
```bash
cd ~/Downloads
unzip displaylink-driver.zip
```

Step 8: Give execute permissions to the installer script
```bash
cd displaylink-driver
sudo chmod 777 run file name
```

Step 9: Run the installer script
```bash
sudo ./run file name
```

Step 10: Disconnect all connected DisplayLink devices (docks or monitors) from your computer.

Step 11: Reboot your system again to finalize the installation
```bash
sudo reboot
```

Please note that this process assumes that the steps you've provided are accurate and that the driver package you've linked is compatible with your version of Ubuntu. Additionally, installing drivers and modifying system files can have risks, so make sure to have backups or a plan in case something goes wrong.
